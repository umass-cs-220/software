## Overview

This course will use a couple of web-based services to manage communication
and assignment submissions. You will be required to create accounts for some of
the systems mentioned below at the start of the course. Failure to do so will
make it difficult for you to complete the course successfully. You will be
notified at the start date of the course and provided instructions on which
applications and/or services you must register for and/or download.

## Piazza

[Piazza][piazza] is an online discussion management system. It will be used as
the hub for communication in this course. All questions and answers will be
posted to Piazza. Your questions will be answered as quickly as possible by
the course staff. You will be responsible for visiting Piazza several times a
day to see updates. We will be posting assignment, quiz, and exam information
on Piazza. You should review the Piazza [feature list][piazza-features] to get
an understanding of how to use Piazza. Please do not email the instructor
and/or teaching assistants directly. All communication should go through
Piazza. It is possible to post directly to the course staff (rather than
public) to discuss anything that should be kept hidden from the rest of the
students. Emailing the course staff directly may go unanswered. You will
receive an invitation to join the course on Piazza on or before the course
start date.

## Moodle

We will be using [Moodle][moodle] for assignment submissions, online quizzes,
and publishing grades. We will not be using Moodle for online discussions. The
rest of the course information including lecture material, project
assignments, quizzes, and exams can be found through the course website. We will
also be using i-clicker in this course for active participation during lectures.
You will need to register your i-clicker remote with Moodle in order for you to
receive a grade for participation. Please log in to Moodle and follow the
[Student registration process][iclicker] to register your remote during the 
first week of class.

## VirtualBox and Vagrant

We will be using [VirtualBox][vbox] and [Vagrant][vagrant] for your
programming environment.  VirtualBox allows you to run a Linux
environment on top of your existing operating system (Mac OSX,
Windows, Linux). You will need to download and install VirtualBox for
your operating system. In addition, we will be using the Vagrant tool
that makes loading up your development environment easier and
configure it according to the requirements of this course. You will
need to download and install Vagrant for your operating system. After
you install VirtualBox and Vagrant you can download the course
[Vagrantfile][vagrant-file] to boot up the course environment. Make
sure you are connected to a reliable network before starting. The
install process may take a while, so grab a coffee and enjoy the wait!

## Command Line, Editors, and IDEs

The bulk of this course focuses on using the command line and text
editors as our programming environment. We do this to give you a solid
understanding of how programming really works and to remove the
guidance provided by integrated development environments. Although the
IDE guidance is very helpful it can often become a crutch that is
relied upon too much. This is especially true for the beginning
programmer. To truly become a master you must be able to think about
your problems and programs and know how to find the answers yourself
rather than rely on auto completion. Toward the later part of the
semester we will look at modern IDEs and allow you to use them for
your assignments if you wish. Here are some recommended text editors:

* emacs (cross platform)
* vim (cross platform)

Becoming acquainted with one or both of the above editors is important
for any programmer. These are installed in the vagrant environment and
you will see them used by the instructor and TAs. You may also
consider the following editors:

* Sublime Text (cross platform)
* Notepad++ (windows only)

We recommend against picking an editor designed only for a particular
operating system. We will look at the following IDEs later in the
course:

* IntelliJ (cross platform)
* Eclipse (cross platform)
